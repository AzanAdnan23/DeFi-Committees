Building a decentralized application (DApp) on the blockchain for your committee system involves defining the necessary UI pages and functionalities. Here's a basic breakdown of the pages and functionalities you might consider:

    ### UI Pages:
    
    1. **Home Page:**
       - Overview of the committee system.
       - Option to create or join a committee.
       - Display of existing committees and their status.
    
    2. **Create Committee Page:**
       - Form to set up a new committee.
       - Input for the number of members.
       - Input for the fixed monthly contribution amount.
       - Option to invite members.
    
    3. **Join Committee Page:**
       - List of available committees to join.
       - Join button for each committee.
       - Information about the committee, such as the number of members and fixed amount.
    
    4. **Committee Dashboard:**
       - Overview of the committee details (number of members, monthly contribution, etc.).
       - List of committee members.
       - Current status of the committee cycle (who is receiving funds this month).
    
    5. **Committee Transactions Page:**
       - History of transactions within the committee.
       - Details of each transaction, including sender, receiver, and amount.
    
    6. **Profile Page:**
       - User details.
       - List of committees the user is part of.
       - Transaction history for the user.
    
    ### Functionalities:
    
    1. **Committee Creation:**
       - Smart contract function to create a new committee.
       - Specify the number of members and the fixed monthly contribution.
    
    2. **Joining a Committee:**
       - Smart contract function to allow users to join a committee.
    
    3. **Monthly Contribution:**
       - Smart contract function to handle the monthly contributions from each member.
    
    4. **Cycle Distribution:**
       - Smart contract logic to distribute the pooled funds to a committee member each month.
       - Update the status of the committee cycle.
    
    5. **Committee Status:**
       - Smart contract function to check the current status of the committee.
    
    6. **Transaction History:**
       - Smart contract function to retrieve transaction history for a user or a committee.
    
    7. **Security and Access Control:**
       - Implement proper access controls to ensure that only authorized users can perform certain actions.
    
    8. **Notifications:**

    9. **Smart Contract Events:**
       - Emit events from the smart contract for important actions, allowing the UI to update in response to changes on the blockchain.
    
    10. **User Authentication:**
        - Implement user authentication to ensure the security of user accounts.
